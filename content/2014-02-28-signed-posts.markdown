My posts on this site are now signed. You can find a gpg-block in the source
code of the page. Pass it to gpg, and you get the markdown used for
generating the site and check the signiture, if you have my GPG key installed.

Thanks to [Merovius](https://blog.merovius.de/)
for the [neat jekyll plugin](https://blog.merovius.de/2014/01/23/signed-blog-posts.html)
achieving this!
