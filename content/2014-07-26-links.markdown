But I think the general premise holds, and that the article itself is full of logic fallacies.

E.g. the "Lump of labor fallacy" does not apply to necessary work, which supplies elementary necessities for living, e.g. water, food and accommodation, for which most people have to work nonetheless.

Also there is no need for explicit coordination of a "ruling class". Acting on their own interest of people with financial and political means creates a "ruling class" by itself, and a filter that mainly allows people with similar ideas to raise to that position.
