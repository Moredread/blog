The octopress developers removed the twitter sidebar in march, as I just
discovered, as I was upgrading my opctopress installation.

To restore it you basically have to create a custom aside file and include a widget created on
the Twitter website.

[This blogpost](http://blog.jmac.org/blog/2013/03/30/putting-twitter-back-into-octopress/)
describes how to do it.

I'm not sure yet if I'll restore it, as it loads javascript and content from
Twitter without the visitors consent.
